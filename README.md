Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges website](link to appropriate section).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges, open up the project in Xcode, and drag ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges.framework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

**Delete the inappropriate sections (and alter the chart/grid name in the sample code if appropriate):**

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up ViewController.m and add the following line after the chart is initialised:

    chart.licenseKey=@"your license key";

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up AppDelegate.m, import `<ShinobiGrids/ShinobiDataGrid.h>`, and set the license key inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` as follows:

    #import <ShinobiGrids/ShinobiDataGrid.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [ShinobiDataGrids setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
        …
    }

If you’re using the trial version you’ll need to add your license key. To do so, open up AppDelegate.m, import `<ShinobiEssentials/ShinobiEssentials.h>`, and set the license key inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` as follows:

    #import <ShinobiEssentials/ShinobiEssentials.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [SEssentials setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
        …
    }

If you’re using the trial version you’ll need to add your license key. To do so, open up AppDelegate.m, import `<ShinobiGauges/ShinobiGauges.h>`, and set the license key inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` as follows:

    #import <ShinobiGauges/ShinobiGauges.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [ShinobiGauges setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
        …
    }
