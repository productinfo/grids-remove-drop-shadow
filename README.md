Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobGrids. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiGrids website](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/ios/shinobigrids).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiGrids, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiGrids, open up the project in Xcode, and drag ShinobiGrids.framework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up AppDelegate.m, import `<ShinobiGrids/ShinobiGrids.h>`, and set the license key inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` as follows:

    #import <ShinobiGrids/ShinobiGrids.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [ShinobiGrids setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
        â€¦
    }
